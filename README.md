# video_pop_up
jquery project to open a pop up video player that is draggable and resizable

Procedure to run the project:
1) Clone the project.
2) Include jquery file in the folder and accordingly mention the path in the html file.
3) It makes use of jquery UI also. So make sure you include that too.
4) Provide the path of the video in the "src" attribute of the <video> tag.
5) The project should be good to go.
6) Ask for queries if any.

Note- The project is not very visually appealing. I am open to changes that you share.

Thank you.
